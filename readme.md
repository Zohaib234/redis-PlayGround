# Express.js and Redis Caching Example

This is a simple Express.js application that demonstrates how to use Redis to cache API responses. The application fetches data from an external API and stores it in Redis. On subsequent requests, it returns the cached data if available.

## Features

- Returns cached data if available, reducing external API calls
- Simple and efficient caching mechanism

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Redis server
